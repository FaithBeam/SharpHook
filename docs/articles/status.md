# Library Status

SharpHook is under active development. The code itself is basically done at this point, and I'm wating for the .NET 6 GA
release. When it's out, I'm going to release version 1.0.0.

No other features are planned, but I will maintain the library to keep up with the releases of libuiohook which uses a
rolling release model - every commit to its `1.2` branch is considered stable. That said, libuiohook itself is not
really active anymore, but is still maintained, so this library will most probably receive updates quite rarely.
